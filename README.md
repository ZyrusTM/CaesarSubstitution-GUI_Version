# CaesarSubstitution-GUI_Version

An improved version of my Caesar Substitution Project that now has an GUI.

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by 
a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift
of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after 
Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

For simplicity, only letters from A to Z are accepted as input. That means umlauts or similar are not supported.
